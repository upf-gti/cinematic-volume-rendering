# cinematic-volume-rendering

 This project utilizes the MeVisLab software tool (version 3.5.0 or above) to develop the cinematic rendering pipeline.

 # Introduction
Cinematic rendering (CR) is a powerful technique that enhances the visualization of medical imaging data by incorporating advanced lighting and material properties. By combining different available modules in the MeVisLab visual programming environment, we have created a flexible and customizable workflow for generating high-quality cinematic renderings of CT data.

 # Installation
To use this CR pipeline, ensure you have MeVisLab software installed on your personal computer. MeVisLab can be downloaded from www.mevislab.de. After installation, you can open the project file provided and explore the network to understand the implementation details.

 # Getting started
1. Ensure you have MeVisLab software version 3.5.0 or later installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the project repository from GitHub.
3. Open MeVisLab and import the provided project file.
4. Load the DICOM files and run the application using either of the following methods:
* Press **Ctrl + R**: Hold the Ctrl key on your keyboard and simultaneously press the R key to execute the graphical user interface (GUI).
* Access the "**Scripting**" menu in the MeVisLab interface and choose "**Start Network Script**" from the appropriate tab menu to initiate the graphical user interface (GUI).
